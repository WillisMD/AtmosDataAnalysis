# AtmosDataAnalysis
Python 3 scripts I use often for analysis of observational data

1. simple function to bin aircraft data by altitude
2. script to import [NETCARE](https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/special_issue835.html) ICARTT files (NETCARE data available [here](http://crd-data-donnees-rdc.ec.gc.ca/CCCMA/products/NETCARE/))
3. script to match data with irregular time stamps
